# Sundae Takehome Project

My biggest challenge was getting margins and padding to cooperate. I started the component by implementing the image first. For the image, I screenshotted the smiley box and uploaded it to AWS S3. Once I had the image rendered as a component, I needed a container to enclose both the image element and the steps component that I would make. Getting these 2 components to have proper spacing proved challenging and it's something I definitely will practice more.

I think getting the font-size for the descriptions proved challenging. That's where I got stuck and didn't figure out how to get the same thinness as the screenshot's text.

To improve the page, I think going back and dynamically rendering the steps component would be better. My MVP approach works but could be cleaner. And definitely will improve the spacing of the elements and the font-size/font-weight. Button currently is not clickable so that needs to be changed.
